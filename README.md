# Track-Your-Employees

## Purpose

A command-line application to manage a company's employee database.

When the user is prompted with the options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, adda department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role. When they choose to view all departments they are then presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids. When they choose to view all roles they are presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
WHEN I choose to view all employees they are presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to. When they choose to add a department they are prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database. When they choose to add a role they are prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database. When I choose to add an employee they are prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database. When they choose to update an employee role they are then prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database. This was achieved by using node.js and the npms: Inquirer, MySql2, console-table-printer.
